Hi there,

Attached is the minimum amount of data you should need to process with the challenge.

I would like to repeat that the intent here really is to give you freedom to engage with an open-ended problem and bring solutions that better highlight where your core knowledge lies.

Are you an awesome UI focused developer?<br>
Do you really stand out when handling data and APIs?<br>
Or maybe is it your code wide organization and architecture that shines?

Requirements wise you should have in your code **React**, **Typescript** and **TailwindCSS**.<br>
All else is optional.

Hope to hear from you soon, see ya and have fun!
